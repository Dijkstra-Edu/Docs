# Terms of Service  
**Dijkstra v1.0**

## Introduction and Acceptance

Welcome to Dijkstra, a platform built by students, for students, designed to support your academic and professional journey. By accessing or using Dijkstra, you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service, our Privacy Policy, and any additional terms presented within specific features.

If you do not agree to these Terms, you must not access or use Dijkstra or any related services. If you use Dijkstra on behalf of an institution or organization, you represent that you have authority to bind that entity and that "you" refers to both you and that entity.

## Eligibility and Accounts

To use Dijkstra, you must:

- Be a student or recent graduate (or otherwise eligible user) as defined by Dijkstra from time to time.
- Be at least the minimum age required by applicable law to enter into a binding contract, or have parental/guardian consent where required.

When you create an account, you agree to:

- Provide accurate, complete, and current information (including IDs, academic marks, and other documents).
- Keep your login credentials confidential and not share your account with others.
- Notify Dijkstra immediately of any unauthorized use of your account.

Dijkstra may suspend or terminate accounts that violate these Terms or where information is suspected to be inaccurate, misleading, or fraudulent.

## Documents and Data You Provide

To use Dijkstra, you may be asked to provide or connect:

- **Identification:** Aadhar, driving license, PAN card, or similar IDs.
- **Login details:** College or personal email and phone number.
- **Connections:** LinkedIn profile, GitHub repository links.
- **Academic documents:** Soft copies of latest end-semester results, 10th and 12th grade results, and other academic records.

You confirm you have the right to provide this information and that it is accurate and up to date.

## How We Use Your Data

Dijkstra uses your submitted data—such as verification IDs, academic marks, project details, LinkedIn profiles, and GitHub repositories—to:

- Verify your eligibility and profile.
- Match you with opportunities (such as internships, projects, or events).
- Provide personalized recommendations and improve our services.

Your data is not shared publicly and is not shared with third parties without your explicit consent, except:

- Where required by law or legal process.
- With trusted service providers (e.g., hosting, analytics, verification providers) acting under strict confidentiality and data-protection obligations.

For more information on how we collect, use, store, and protect your personal data, please refer to our separate Privacy Policy, which forms part of these Terms.

## User Responsibilities and Acceptable Use

You agree not to:

- Provide false, misleading, or incomplete information (such as fabricated marks or documents).
- Impersonate any person or entity or misrepresent your affiliation with a college, university, or employer.
- Use Dijkstra for unlawful activities, including fraud, harassment, discrimination, or the distribution of malware or unauthorized marketing.
- Scrape, reverse engineer, copy, or otherwise misuse Dijkstra, including its data, interfaces, or underlying code, except as expressly allowed by law.

Dijkstra may investigate and take action (including suspension or termination) if it suspects any violation of this section.

## Platform Services and No Guarantee of Outcomes

Dijkstra aims to connect students with academic and professional opportunities, such as internships, jobs, projects, or events. However:

- Dijkstra does not guarantee that you will receive any internship, job, admission, funding, or other opportunity.
- Decisions about selection, hiring, or admission are made by third-party organizations (e.g., employers, institutions), not by Dijkstra.

You are solely responsible for:

- Evaluating the suitability, legality, and safety of any opportunity or third party.
- Any commitments you make to third parties, including contracts or offers you accept.

## Intellectual Property

All rights in and to Dijkstra—including its software, design, logos, brand, content, and underlying technology—are owned by or licensed to Dijkstra and are protected by applicable intellectual property laws.

Subject to these Terms, Dijkstra grants you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to access and use the platform for your personal, non-commercial academic and professional development. You may not copy, modify, distribute, sell, or lease any part of Dijkstra except as expressly permitted by these Terms or applicable law.

## User Content and License to Dijkstra

You may upload or provide content such as projects, portfolios, resumes, profiles, links, and other materials ("User Content"). You retain ownership of your User Content.

By submitting User Content, you grant Dijkstra a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use, host, store, reproduce, modify, display, and distribute that content solely for the purpose of operating, improving, and promoting Dijkstra and matching you with opportunities.

## Third-Party Services and Links

Dijkstra may integrate or link to third-party services, such as LinkedIn, GitHub, job portals, or institutional systems. These services are governed by their own terms and policies, and Dijkstra is not responsible for their content, practices, or decisions.

Your interactions with third parties (including employers and institutions) are solely between you and those third parties.

## Disclaimers

To the maximum extent permitted by law, Dijkstra and its affiliates provide the services "as is" and "as available", without any warranties of any kind, whether express, implied, or statutory, including implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement.

Without limiting the foregoing, Dijkstra does not warrant that:

- The platform will be uninterrupted, secure, or error-free.
- Any particular opportunities, outcomes, or results will be achieved.
- Content provided on or through the platform is complete, accurate, or up to date, especially where contributed by users or third parties.

## Limitation of Liability

To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law:

- Dijkstra and its directors, officers, employees, and partners will not be liable for any indirect, incidental, consequential, special, or punitive damages, including loss of profits, data, goodwill, or opportunities, arising out of or related to your use of the platform.
- The total aggregate liability of Dijkstra for all claims arising out of or related to the services or these Terms will not exceed the greater of: (a) the amount you have paid to Dijkstra (if any) in the six (6) months preceding the event giving rise to the claim, or (b) [Rs. X or other reasonable cap].

Nothing in these Terms limits liability that cannot be limited under applicable law (such as for gross negligence or intentional misconduct where such limitations are not permitted).

## Indemnity

You agree to indemnify and hold harmless Dijkstra and its affiliates from and against any claims, damages, losses, liabilities, and expenses (including reasonable legal fees) arising out of or related to:

- Your use of Dijkstra.
- Your violation of these Terms or applicable law.
- Your User Content or any information you provide, including inaccurate or fraudulent documents.

## Changes to the Services and Terms

Dijkstra may modify, suspend, or discontinue any part of the services at any time, with or without notice, where legally permitted.

Dijkstra may also update these Terms from time to time. When changes are made, the "Last updated" date will be revised, and, where required, you will be notified or asked to accept the updated Terms. Your continued use of the services after the effective date of any changes constitutes your acceptance of the updated Terms.

## Termination

You may stop using Dijkstra at any time and may request account deletion in accordance with our Privacy Policy. Dijkstra may suspend or terminate your access to the services if you breach these Terms, misuse the platform, or if required by law or an institution partnership.

Upon termination:

- Your right to use the services ends immediately.
- Some provisions that by their nature should survive (such as intellectual property, disclaimers, limitations of liability, and dispute provisions) will continue to apply.

## Governing Law and Dispute Resolution

These Terms are governed by the laws of [Jurisdiction – e.g., Republic of India], without regard to conflict-of-laws principles.

Any disputes arising out of or relating to these Terms or your use of Dijkstra shall first be attempted to be resolved amicably through good-faith negotiations. If not resolved within days, disputes shall be submitted to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located in [City, Country], unless applicable law requires a different forum.

If you are in a jurisdiction that requires arbitration or prohibits certain dispute provisions, the dispute terms will be adapted as required by law.

## Miscellaneous

If any provision of these Terms is held invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions will continue in full force and effect. Failure to enforce any right or provision is not a waiver of that right or provision.

These Terms, together with the Privacy Policy and any supplemental terms or agreements, constitute the entire agreement between you and Dijkstra regarding your use of the services and supersede any prior agreements on the same subject.
