## Change Organization Visibility

Once the drop down menu opens, you will notice two options, a 'Public' option and a 'Private' option with a check mark next to it. The check mark indicates that your current organization status is private. Click on the 'Public' option to finally publicise your organization status. If there is already a check mark next to the public option, it means that your organization status is already public.
