# Privacy Policy

**Effective Date:** 18 January 2026

Dijkstra, an open-source platform created by and for students, is committed to protecting your privacy. As an open-source project, our code is publicly available on [https://github.com/Dijkstra-Edu](https://github.com/Dijkstra-Edu), allowing community review for transparency and security. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, share, and protect your personal information when you use our Services.

By using Dijkstra, you agree to this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Service.

## Information we collect

Dijkstra may collect the following types of information to provide and improve the services:

- **Identification data:** Aadhar, PAN, driving license or similar IDs, student IDs, and other verification documents you upload.
- **Contact and login data:** Name, college or personal email, phone number, passwords (stored in encrypted form), and institution details.
- **Academic data:** Soft copies of end-semester results, 10th and 12th grade results, transcripts, marksheets, and other academic records.
- **Profile and professional data:** LinkedIn profile links, GitHub repositories, portfolios, resumes, project descriptions, skills, and interests.
- **Usage data:** Device information, IP address, browser type, pages viewed, time spent, and interactions with features, collected through logs or similar technologies.
- **Optional data:** Any additional information you choose to provide (such as preferences, feedback, or survey responses).

We do not intentionally collect more data than necessary for verification, matching opportunities, and operating Dijkstra.

## How we use your information

Dijkstra uses your information to:

- Verify your identity, eligibility, and academic background.
- Create and manage your account and profile.
- Match you with relevant opportunities such as internships, jobs, projects, or events, and provide personalized recommendations.
- Operate, maintain, and improve the platform, including troubleshooting, analytics, and new feature development.
- Communicate with you about updates, changes, support, and security notices.
- Comply with legal obligations and prevent fraud, misuse, or security incidents.

We do not use your personal data for third-party advertising or sell your personal data.

## How we share and do not share data

Dijkstra does not share your personal data publicly and does not make your IDs, marks, or sensitive documents visible to the general public or other users by default.

We may share your information only in these limited situations:

- **With your consent:** For example, when you apply to an opportunity, we may share necessary profile, academic, and project information with the relevant employer, institution, or partner.
- **Service providers:** With trusted third-party vendors (such as hosting providers, cloud infrastructure, analytics, or verification providers) who process data on our behalf under strict confidentiality and data-protection obligations.
- **Legal requirements:** When required by law, regulation, legal process, or governmental request, or to protect Dijkstra’s rights, safety, or the rights and safety of others.
- **Business changes:** If Dijkstra is involved in a merger, reorganization, or similar event, your information may be transferred subject to continued protections consistent with this Policy.

We do not publish your personal data in public repositories, open-source code, issue trackers, or similar public channels.

## Legal basis and consent

Where required by applicable law, Dijkstra relies on one or more of the following legal bases to process your personal data:

- Your consent (for example, when you upload documents, connect LinkedIn/GitHub, or apply to opportunities).
- Performance of a contract (providing the Dijkstra services under the Terms of Service).
- Compliance with legal obligations (such as record-keeping or fraud prevention).
- Legitimate interests (such as improving services and ensuring security), balanced against your rights and expectations.

You may withdraw your consent at any time where consent is the basis of processing, but this may limit your ability to use certain features.

## Data security

Dijkstra uses reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect your information against unauthorized access, loss, misuse, alteration, or destruction.

These may include:

- Encryption in transit and at rest where appropriate.
- Access controls and role-based permissions.
- Secure storage of verification documents and academic records.
- Regular monitoring for suspicious activity.

No system can be guaranteed 100% secure, but Dijkstra aims to minimize risks through industry-aligned practices for protecting student data.

## Data retention

Dijkstra keeps your personal data only for as long as necessary to:

- Provide the services and maintain your account.
- Meet legal, regulatory, or contractual obligations.
- Resolve disputes or enforce agreements.

In general:

- Data linked to your account is retained while your account is active.
- After account deletion or inactivity, data may be retained for a limited period (for example, [insert period, e.g., 1-3 years]) for legal, security, or backup purposes, after which it is deleted or irreversibly anonymized.

## Your rights and choices

Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have rights such as:

- Accessing the personal data Dijkstra holds about you.
- Requesting correction of inaccurate or incomplete data.
- Requesting deletion of your data, subject to legal or contractual limits.
- Objecting to or restricting certain types of processing.
- Requesting a copy of your data in a portable format where applicable.

## Third-party services and links

When you connect or use third-party services such as LinkedIn, GitHub, job portals, or institutional systems through Dijkstra, their handling of your information is governed by their own terms and privacy policies.

Dijkstra is not responsible for the privacy practices, content, or decisions of third-party services, and encourages you to review their policies separately.

## International transfers

If Dijkstra stores or processes data on servers located outside your state or country (for example, via cloud providers), your data may be transferred to jurisdictions that may have different data protection laws.

Dijkstra will take appropriate steps to ensure an adequate level of protection for such transfers, consistent with applicable law.

## Children and minors

Dijkstra is intended for students who meet the minimum age required by applicable law to provide valid consent or enter into a contract.

Where required, parental or guardian consent will be obtained for users below the legal age of consent. Dijkstra does not knowingly collect personal data from children who are not legally permitted to use the service; such data will be deleted if discovered.

## Changes to this Privacy Policy

Dijkstra may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When changes are made:

- The “Last updated” date at the top will be revised.
- Where required by law or considered material, you may be notified or prompted to review or accept the updated Policy.

Your continued use of Dijkstra after the effective date of changes means you accept the updated Policy.
