# Dijkstra Contributor License Agreement v1.0

## Purpose

This Contributor License Agreement is for your protection as a contributor, as well as for the protection of Dijkstra and the users of the Dijkstra project. It clarifies the intellectual property rights you grant when you submit contributions so that Dijkstra can safely use, modify, and redistribute them as part of the Dijkstra project and related works.

This Agreement applies to all Contributions that you Submit to Dijkstra now or in the future, unless and until it is superseded by a later written agreement between you and Dijkstra.

If you submit Contributions on behalf of different companies and/or individuals, a separate Contributor License Agreement must be concluded for each such company and/or individual.

You accept this Agreement by signing it, or, if there is no signed copy, by Submitting any Contribution to the Dijkstra project after the date of this Agreement.

## Definitions

For purposes of this Agreement, the following definitions apply:

### “You”
The individual who Submits a Contribution to Dijkstra and is the copyright owner of the Contribution, or is otherwise authorized by the copyright owner to enter into this Agreement.

### “Contribution”
Any original work of authorship, including any modifications or additions to an existing work of authorship, that is Submitted by You to Dijkstra for potential inclusion in, or use with, the Dijkstra project. A Contribution may include, for example:

- Source code, binaries, configuration, tests, and build scripts.
- Documentation, specifications, designs, diagrams, artwork, and other content.
- Comments, issues, reviews, and other written or verbal material, except where clearly marked by You as “Not a Contribution”.

### “Patented Contribution”

- A Contribution, or
- A combination of one or more Contributions, or

in respect of which You own or control one or more valid patents and the rights arising in connection with those patents.

### “Dijkstra project”
Any software or documentation project owned, initiated, or managed by Dijkstra, including its repositories, modules, sub-projects, documentation sets, and related materials that Dijkstra designates as part of the Dijkstra project.

### “Contribution Date”
The date on which You first Submit a given Contribution to Dijkstra through any accepted channel (for example, Git hosting platform, code review system, or issue tracker).

### “Submit” (or “Submitted”)
Any act of uploading, transmitting, submitting, or distributing a Contribution to Dijkstra by any electronic, audiovisual, verbal, written, or other means, including but not limited to:

- Source code control systems (such as Git repositories and pull requests)
- Issue tracking systems
- Online project management systems or discussion forums

used or managed by or on behalf of Dijkstra for the purpose of discussing, evaluating, improving, or including the Contribution in the Dijkstra project.

### “Dijkstra users”
All users of the Dijkstra project, including those who receive a given Contribution directly or indirectly from Dijkstra, whether in source or object form, through compiled binaries, package managers, or other distribution channels.

## Grant of Copyright License

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, You grant to Dijkstra and to Dijkstra users a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable license to:

- Use, reproduce, modify, adapt, and prepare derivative works of the Contribution.
- Publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the Contribution and any derivative works.
- Combine the Contribution with other software or materials as part of the Dijkstra project or other works.
- Distribute the Contribution and derivative works under the applicable Outbound License(s) chosen by Dijkstra for the relevant project or component.

Unless Dijkstra explicitly states otherwise for a particular project, **inbound = outbound** will apply, meaning that Contributions are intended to be licensed under the same Outbound License(s) as the Dijkstra project to which the Contribution is made.

---

## Grant of Patent License

If and to the extent that any Patented Contribution is included in the Dijkstra project, You hereby grant to Dijkstra and to Dijkstra users a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) license under Your patent rights that are necessarily infringed by the use, reproduction, modification, or distribution of such Patented Contribution, to:

- Make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Patented Contribution as part of the Dijkstra project.
- Practice any methods or processes embodied in the Patented Contribution as used within the Dijkstra project.

This patent license is granted only to the extent required for using, modifying, or distributing the Patented Contribution as part of, or in connection with, the Dijkstra project and does not grant any patent rights beyond those necessary for that purpose.

### Patent Retaliation (optional clause)

If any entity institutes patent litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) against Dijkstra or any Dijkstra user alleging that the Dijkstra project or any Contribution (including Your Contribution) infringes a patent, then any patent licenses granted by You under this Agreement to that entity shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

---

## Representations and Warranties

You represent and warrant that, to the best of Your knowledge:

- You have the legal right and authority to Submit the Contribution under the terms of this Agreement. If Your employer or another party owns intellectual property rights in the Contribution, You have received permission from that party to Submit the Contribution and grant the licenses described in this Agreement on their behalf.
- The Contribution is Your original creation or You otherwise have sufficient rights to grant the licenses set out in this Agreement, and You have disclosed any third-party components in the Contribution, including their license terms.
- The Contribution does not intentionally contain malicious code, backdoors, or other hidden functionality designed to harm the Dijkstra project, Dijkstra users, or third parties.

You agree to notify Dijkstra as soon as reasonably practicable if You become aware of any facts or circumstances that would reasonably cause any of the representations above to be inaccurate in any material respect.

---

## Disclaimer of Warranty

EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY STATED IN THIS AGREEMENT, YOU PROVIDE THE CONTRIBUTION “AS IS” WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Dijkstra is under no obligation to use or include Your Contribution in any Dijkstra project.

---

## Limitation of Liability

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL YOU BE LIABLE TO DIJKSTRA OR TO ANY DIJKSTRA USER FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES OF ANY KIND ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR THE USE OF YOUR CONTRIBUTION, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

Your total cumulative liability arising out of or relating to this Agreement and Your Contributions shall not exceed the amount of fees (if any) actually paid to You by Dijkstra specifically for those Contributions.

---

## Third-Party Licenses and Notices

If Your Contribution incorporates or depends on any third-party code, data, or other material that is subject to a license or other legal terms, You agree to:

- Identify such third-party material and its applicable license(s) in the Contribution or associated documentation.
- Ensure that the incorporation of such material into the Dijkstra project is consistent with the Outbound License(s) chosen by Dijkstra and does not impose additional obligations on Dijkstra or Dijkstra users beyond those terms.

Dijkstra may ask You to remove or replace third-party components if they are incompatible with the applicable Outbound License(s) or project policies.

---

## Contribution Process and Governance

You acknowledge that:

- Dijkstra will decide, at its sole discretion, whether and how to include Your Contribution in the Dijkstra project, including modifications, refactoring, or rejection of the Contribution.
- Contributions must follow the Dijkstra project’s contribution guidelines, coding standards, code of conduct, and review processes as published in project documentation, repositories, or websites from time to time.

Dijkstra may relicense or dual-license the Dijkstra project (including Your Contributions) under additional licenses, provided that such licensing remains consistent with the rights granted to You under this Agreement.

---

## Term and Termination

This Agreement becomes effective on the date You first accept it (by signing or by Submitting a Contribution after the date of this Agreement) and continues indefinitely for all Contributions You Submit, unless terminated in accordance with this section.

You may terminate this Agreement for future Contributions by providing written notice to Dijkstra; however, such termination will not affect the licenses already granted for Contributions Submitted prior to the effective date of termination.

Dijkstra may terminate this Agreement as to future Contributions upon written notice to You. Termination by either party does not affect any rights granted to Dijkstra or Dijkstra users under licenses already granted for existing Contributions.

Any patent licenses granted under this Agreement may terminate earlier in accordance with the Patent Retaliation clause (if included).

---

## Miscellaneous

- This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between You and Dijkstra with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous agreements relating to the same subject matter, except where Dijkstra has expressly agreed in writing to additional or different terms.
- If any provision of this Agreement is held to be unenforceable, that provision shall be modified to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable, and the remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect.
- This Agreement will be governed by and constructed in accordance with the laws of the Indian Contract Act, 1872, and Copyright Act, 1957, without regard to its conflict-of-laws rules. Any disputes arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of Bangalore, unless Dijkstra specifies different dispute resolution mechanisms in its project policies.
