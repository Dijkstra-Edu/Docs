Welcome to **Dijkstra** - a community-driven, open-source platform designed to empower Computer Science students, especially those from Tier-2 and Tier-3 colleges in India, to become industry-ready professionals.

## What is Dijkstra?

Dijkstra is more than just a learning platform - it's a complete ecosystem built **by students, for students**. Our mission is to bridge the skill and opportunity gap through:

- **Community-driven mentorship** - Learn from peers and seniors who've been in your shoes
- **Curated learning paths** - Master CS fundamentals, development skills, and soft skills systematically
- **Real-world project experience** - Build production-ready applications collaboratively
- **Holistic skill development** - Grow as a developer through DSA, software engineering, and systems design

## Core Philosophy

> *"Run by students, for students."*

We believe that the best way to learn is by doing, and the best way to grow is together. Dijkstra is not just about consuming content - it's about actively participating in a vibrant community where every contribution matters.
