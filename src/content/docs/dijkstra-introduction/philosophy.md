## Our Philosophy

At its core, **Dijkstra** is built around a simple idea:  
if you **make progress visible**, **focus on fundamentals**, and **learn in public with others**, you can change your career—and your life.

We do this through a set of guiding principles that shape everything we build.

## Core Principles

### 1. Visibility

Track your progress across platforms like GitHub, LinkedIn, LeetCode, Codeforces, and more. See yourself level up through validated Proof of Work.

### 2. Develop Skills

Sharpen your DSA, Software Engineering, and Systems Design with tasks like code pushes, articles, mentoring, and leading projects.

### 3. Proof of Work

Your growth is visible across multiple platforms. Dijkstra helps gamify this journey, guiding you to plan and execute effectively.

### 4. Efficiency

A project can double up as a research paper or portfolio piece. Dijkstra helps you align efforts to maximize output.

### 5. Community

Give back by writing, coding, mentoring, and contributing. Build credibility and grow with the global tech community.

### 6. Growth Mindset

Everything leads to something bigger—internships, articles, or research. Dijkstra helps connect the dots for your career.
