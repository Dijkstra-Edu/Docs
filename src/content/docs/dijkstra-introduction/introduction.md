## Your Career in Software Starts Here

Welcome to **Dijkstra**, an open-source, free-for-all platform designed to help you crack software engineering jobs with ease.

## For Students, By Students

**Dijkstra** is built by students, for students. We understand the challenges you face because we've been there. Our platform is designed to provide the guidance, community, and real-world experience that many students lack in traditional educational settings.

## So what's Dijkstra?

**Dijkstra** is a one-stop, open-source platform for aspiring Software Engineers to prepare and crack jobs in today's competitive landscape.

At its core, Dijkstra works on the following principles:

- **Visibility** - Track your progress across platforms like GitHub, LinkedIn, Leetcode, Codeforces, and more. See yourself level up through validated Proof of Work.
- **Develop Skills** - Sharpen your DSA, Software Engineering, and Systems Design with tasks like code pushes, articles, mentoring, and leading projects.
- **Proof of Work** - Your growth is visible across multiple platforms. Dijkstra helps gamify this journey, guiding you to plan and execute effectively.
- **Efficiency** - A project can double up as a research paper or portfolio piece. Dijkstra helps you align efforts to maximize output.
- **Community** - Give back by writing, coding, mentoring, and contributing. Build credibility and grow with the global tech community.
- **Growth Mindset** - Everything leads to something bigger—internships, articles, or research. Dijkstra helps connect the dots for your career.
