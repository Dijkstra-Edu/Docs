## So how does this work?

Dijkstra helps you track progress and prepare towards CS roles. This is mainly aimed towards aspiring Software Engineers still in University, but it can be used by anyone who would like to break into tech!

## Getting Started

Choose the path that fits you best:

- **Path 1**: Absolute Beginners
- **Path 2**: University and Experienced Students

---

## Path 1: Absolute Beginners

### 0) Onboarding with Dijkstra

Get started by setting up everything you need—from important sites to code editors. Time taken depends on your knowledge of Git (or other version control systems).

- **Time**: 30 minutes to 3 hours

### 1) Learning to Code

Get started with the fundamentals of coding. Learn the basics, then build up knowledge useful for both projects and technical interviews.

- **Time**: 4–8 weeks

### 2) Gaining Value from Learning to Code

Now the fun begins. Build simple projects while progressing in your understanding of logic through DSA.

- **Time**: 1–2 months

#### Start working on Projects

Project length depends on scope: anywhere from 3 hours to a week. The expectation is to complete multiple projects to better understand how to use code practically.

#### Getting started with DSA and LeetCode

Understanding DSA goes a long way in being able to code what you think in an effective manner. This can take a while—potentially a month of serious study.

### Start Applying to S-tier Opportunities

These could be top-of-the-line industry opportunities, research positions, or partner companies.

Keep working on LeetCode and DSA, preferably company-specific problems.

Have your resume, CV, and your story in order.

Do mock interviews with members from the community.

Brush up on general knowledge. Everything on your resume is fair game.

### Prepare to Slow down work @ Dijkstra

You've done it. You've achieved a top-tier job—hopefully one that's well-compensated. All the hard work has paid off.

Around here, you are moved away from development within Dijkstra to focus on your new chapter.

### Mentoring + Management @ Dijkstra

You have the option to continue working at Dijkstra as a Mentor or as a Technical Lead in Dijkstra's various projects. This could be experience that you can use to leverage better opportunities in your own career.

The other option is to step down into a community member role: a passive, but lifelong member of the Dijkstra community.

- **Duration**: Ongoing (indefinite)

## Path 2: For University and Experienced Students

### 0) Onboarding with Dijkstra

Get started by setting up everything you need—from important sites to code editors. Time taken depends on your knowledge of Git (or other version control systems).

- **Time**: 30 minutes to 3 hours

### 1) Getting Started with LeetCode

Start by improving your DSA skills by practicing 2 problems a day.

- **Time**: 30 minutes to 3 hours to get up and running (then ongoing daily practice)

### 2) Refactoring Approach to Projects

Revamp profiles, portfolios, and resumes to better reflect your skills and experience.

- **Time**: 2–4 weeks

### 3) Approaching opportunities with Dijkstra and partner organizations

Put everything you've learned so far to use, with the help of Dijkstra and our partner organizations.

- **Time**: Ideally, 1–2 months of work within open-source projects

### 4) Start applying to other Open Source Opportunities

These include fellowships like GSoC, LFX, Outreachy, MLH Fellowship, and more.

- **Time**: 3–6 months (depending on time of year and application cycles)

### Start Applying to S-tier Opportunities

These could be top-of-the-line industry opportunities, research positions, or partner companies.

Keep working on LeetCode and DSA, preferably company-specific problems.
