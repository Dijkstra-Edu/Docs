## Our Mission

It's 2025, and entry-level roles in tech have become fiercely competitive. Many students graduate without offers, competition has intensified, and AI is reshaping traditional roles.

At **Dijkstra**, we firmly believe it is still possible to land **well-compensated, meaningful jobs in tech**—regardless of the noise and uncertainty in the industry.

Our mission is to help students:

- Get back to the **fundamentals of Computer Science**
- **Systematically** prepare for software engineering roles
- Prepare **actively**, not passively

## The Problems Students Face

### 1. Lack of Awareness and Visibility

In India, a large number of students choose Computer Science—but many graduate without a clear idea of:

- How to join top product-based companies  
- What skills actually matter in industry  
- Where to find the right opportunities  

Students from premier institutes (like IITs) are often mentored from day one and graduate **industry-ready**—strong in both development and DSA.  
But students from Tier-2 and Tier-3 colleges are frequently left in the dark throughout their degree.

Critical, industry-standard skills like **Git**, **GitHub**, **Docker**, and **Kubernetes** are often missing from college curricula, even though the industry relies on them heavily.

### 2. Overwhelming Complexity of Computer Science

Computer Science is vast. Interested students often:

- Feel lost trying to navigate everything on their own  
- Struggle to decide what to learn, and in what order  
- Get pulled in multiple directions—courses, videos, roadmaps, bootcamps—without a clear, trusted path  

Over four years of college, students are expected to somehow become "job-ready" by themselves. Without guidance, this leads to confusion, burnout, and missed opportunities.

## How Dijkstra Solves These Issues

**Dijkstra exists to solve these gaps.**  
We aim to:

1. **Bring students together into a real community**  
   - An open-source, student-run space  
   - Safe, inclusive, and mentorship-focused  
   - Designed for anyone passionate about Computer Science, regardless of background  

2. **Define a clear path to success**  
   - Strengthen fundamentals: Data Structures & Algorithms, Operating Systems, Networks, and more  
   - Build **developmental knowledge** to be work-ready in real-world environments  
   - Develop **soft skills** so students are ready on all fronts for a career in tech  

3. **Provide real, hands-on experience**  
   - Students actively hone their skills by contributing to the open-source development of **Dijkstra** itself  
   - Opportunities to work on full-stack development, microservices, and cloud services  
   - Real-world collaboration, reviews, and workflows that mirror industry practice  

## Long-Term Goal

In simple terms, **Dijkstra** aims to be a **one-stop solution** for any aspiring CS student to become **industry-ready and work-ready**.

We want every motivated student—especially from Tier-2 and Tier-3 colleges—to have:

- A clear roadmap  
- A supportive community  
- Real experience they can point to  
- And a fair shot at top-tier opportunities in tech.
