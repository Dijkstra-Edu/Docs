# Introduction

The [Google Summer of Code (GSOC)](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) is a program that allows students to contribute to the development of open-source projects, mentored by participating organizations.

# GSoC 2026

In 2026, Dijkstra aims to participate as a mentoring organization, with the overall aim being to foster good open source activity among students in universities. Please have a look at the general [program rules](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/rules/) and the [timeline](https://hepsoftwarefoundation.org/activities/gsoc.html#timeline) provided by Google.

The selection process in our organization will be split into two phases. All candidates will have to pass pre-selection evaluation tests prepared by mentors, demonstrating the skills needed for the respective projects. The successful candidates will have a detailed exchange with mentors on a given project idea, and their proposals are then evaluated for the final student selection. The detailed [timeline](https://hepsoftwarefoundation.org/activities/gsoc.html#timeline) of these phases is shown below.
