# Introduction

The [Google Summer of Code (GSOC)](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) is a program that allows students to contribute to the development of open-source projects, mentored by participating organizations.

Dijkstra is an open=source organization aimed towards improving CS education in India (and the world!). The world of software is ever changing and evolving, and we would like to be at the forefront to help students prepare for software based jobs, by building up their fundamentals through visibile and credible proof-of-work.

In 2026, Dijkstra aims to participate as a mentoring organization, with the overall aim being to foster good open source activity among students in universities. Please have a look at the general [program rules](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/rules/) and the [timeline](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/timeline) provided by Google.

### Why does Dijkstra wish to participate in GSOC?

It fundamentally aligns with what Dijkstra as an organization wishes to achieve. We would like to open the world of open source to Indian students, the *right* way; by enforcing good coding practices and by continuously improving themselves in the field of Computer Science. Some other ways we benefit from joining GSOC:

- It bring new contributors to the Dijkstra community
- Helps raise the visibility of Dijkstra in the open-source and online education ecosystem
- Pay students so time is not a barrier to participation
- Provide opportunities for existing members to mentor, and to continue the cycle of learning -> mentoring
- Mentors learn, get a chance to practice leadership and improve their communication skills

# For Students

If you are interested in contributing to Dijkstra, please start by having a look at our [Contributor Guidelines](/getting-started/contributors/contribution-guidelines/), details pertaining to crafting your proposal using our [Project Proposal template](/gsoc-2026/project-proposal), as well as the list of [Project Proposals](/gsoc-2026/project-list) and frequently asked questions.

:::caution[Application Process]{icon="right-caret"}
The process for application is simple:
- Take a look at the [Project Proposals](/gsoc-2026/project-proposal), and identify a maximum of *1* projects that you would like to contribute to.
- Complete the Dijkstra Onboarding Flow. This includes joining the GitHub organization, as well as completing the Leetcode Task.
- Try to solve 1-2 small issues from the issue board, more specifically from the project that you are interested in contributing to.
- Send an email to [gsoc@dijkstra.org.in](emailto:gsoc@dijkstra.org.in) expressing your interest, along with a draft of your proposal using our [Project Proposal Template](/gsoc-2026/project-proposal) for your project of choice. Kindly submit this email along with a link to the issues that were resolved as well as the completed Leetcode Tasks.

On confirmation of a successful email, we will continue to collaborate with you on fine tuning your proposal in time for submission.
