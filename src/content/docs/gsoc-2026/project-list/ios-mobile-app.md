**Duration:** 350 Hours \
**Difficulty:** Hard \
**Languages & Technologies:** Swift \
**Repository:** [Dijkstra-Edu/Dijkstra-ios](https://github.com/Dijkstra-Edu/Dijkstra-IOS)

Dijkstra is growing, and we would like to begin expanding into Mobile Software Engineering. We would like to provide students with the opportunity to develop with Swift and follow standard practices within the sphere of IOS App Development. 

## Objectives

- Develop a native iOS application using Swift/SwiftUI
- Recreate core features from Dijkstra Web
    - The Onboarding Flow
    - This includes the Dashboard
    - The Profile View Page
    - Dijkstra GPT
    - The opportunities board
- Ensure responsive design and optimal user experience on iOS devices
- Implement proper navigation and mobile-specific UI patterns

## Requirements

- Experience with iOS development (Swift/SwiftUI)
- Understanding of mobile app architecture
- Familiarity with REST APIs and data fetching
- Knowledge of iOS design guidelines

## Deliverables

- Fully functional iOS application
- Source code with proper documentation
- User documentation
- (optional) Testing infrastructure!

With the final outcome being to launch this application to the playstore!

## Mentors

- Jonathan Samuel ([GitHub](https://github.com/JRS296), [Discord](https://discord.com/jrs296))

> We would like you to hopefully mentor the next generation as well! (This is the Dijkstra way, we learn to teach!) and to hopefully become a codeowner that other developers can look to for knowledge and guidance down the years.
