# Tests - Setup Testing for Dataforge, Helios, Gitripper

**Duration:** Short to Long  
**Difficulty:** Easy

## Overview

This project focuses on establishing a comprehensive testing framework and infrastructure for three key Dijkstra projects: Dataforge, Helios, and Gitripper. The goal is to improve code quality, reliability, and maintainability through proper test coverage.

## Objectives

- Set up testing frameworks for each project
- Write unit tests for core functionality
- Implement integration tests where appropriate
- Set up CI/CD integration for automated testing
- Achieve meaningful test coverage across all three projects

## Requirements

- Understanding of testing principles and methodologies
- Familiarity with testing frameworks (Jest, pytest, etc. depending on project languages)
- Knowledge of CI/CD pipelines
- Ability to write clear, maintainable test cases

## Deliverables

- Testing framework setup for Dataforge, Helios, and Gitripper
- Comprehensive test suites
- CI/CD integration
- Testing documentation and guidelines
