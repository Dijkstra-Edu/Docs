**Repository:** [Dijkstra-Edu/Archivist](https://github.com/Dijkstra-Edu/Archivist)

This project focuses on improving and enhancing the Archivist backend system, which is built with Go, Gin, and MongoDB. The primary goal would be to integrate with the developed [Blog System](https://github.com/Dijkstra-Edu/Blog), and to enable the automatic creation of Blogs based on Leetcode Submissions from Dijkstra community members.

## Objectives

- Integrate with the Frontend
- Develop a CRON/webhook mechanism to auto-create a custom blog for every successful push to the Leetcode Repository
- Integrate admin functionality with [HQ](https://github.com/Dijkstra-Edu/HQ)
- (optional) Implement Testing, as well as getting that coverage up!

## Requirements & Relevant Skills

- Experience with Go programming language
- Understanding of Gin web framework
- Knowledge of MongoDB and database design
- Familiarity with backend architecture and REST APIs
- Understanding of software engineering best practices

## Deliverables

- Completed Integration with Frontend
- Completed Auto-Create mechanism for the Leetcode Blogs
- Updated documentation

## Mentors

> We would like you to hopefully mentor the next generation as well! (This is the Dijkstra way, we learn to teach!) and to hopefully become a codeowner that other developers can look to for knowledge and guidance down the years.
