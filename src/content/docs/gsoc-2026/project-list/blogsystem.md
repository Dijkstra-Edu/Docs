description: Development of a blog system for the Dijkstra platform
---

**Duration:** 175-350 Hours \
**Difficulty:** Medium \
**Languages & Technologies:** TypeScript, Golang \
**Repository:** [Dijkstra-Edu/Dijkstra-Blog](https://github.com/Dijkstra-Edu/Blog), [Dijkstra-Edu/Dijkstra-Web](https://github.com/Dijkstra-Edu/Dijkstra-Web)

This project involves evolving the Dijkstra blog system, Archivist, into a fully fledged and production-ready platform. The system will include robust authentication, comprehensive comment management, add/edit workflows for posts, and a clear authorization and verification mechanism for blog content.

Additionally, the project will introduce a mechanism for the automatic generation of blog posts based on LeetCode submissions from Dijkstra community members, enabling technical contributions and problem-solving insights to be surfaced as structured, shareable blog content.
## Objectives

- Enable GitHub authentication, as well as cross management with the comments system
- Creation of the Add and Edit Blog System on Dijkstra Web
- Administration mechanism for Dijkstra HQ
- Addressing Miscelaneous Bugs
- Develop a CRON/webhook mechanism to auto-create a custom blog for every successful push to the Leetcode Repository
- [Optional] Implement Testing, as well as getting that coverage up!


## Requirements & Relevant Skills

- Understanding of content management systems
- Understanding of software engineering best practices
- Knowledge of MongoDB and database design
- Familiarity with backend APIs and data management
- Understanding of markdown/rich text editing

## Deliverables

- Fully functional blog system
- Content management interface
- Complete Integration with Dijkstra Ecosystem
- Completed Auto-Create mechanism for the Leetcode Blogs
- Updated documentation

> We would like you to hopefully mentor the next generation as well! (This is the Dijkstra way, we learn to teach!) and to hopefully become a codeowner that other developers can look to for knowledge and guidance down the years.
