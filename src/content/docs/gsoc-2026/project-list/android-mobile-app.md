**Duration:** 350 Hours \

**Languages & Technologies:** Kotlin, Android Studio \
**Repository:** [Dijkstra-Edu/Dijkstra-Android](https://github.com/Dijkstra-Edu/Dijkstra-Android)

The Dijkstra platform is currently accessible only as a web application. To improve accessibility and convenience, we plan to introduce Dijkstra mobile applications. This expansion also gives us the opportunity to invite students interested in Kotlin development to collaborate with us in building a responsive, attractive, and easy-to-use Android app. If you'd rather work on iOS App development checkout: [link here]

## Objectives

- Develop a native Android application using Kotlin
- Recreate core features from Dijkstra Web
- Ensure responsive design and optimal user experience on Android devices
- Implement proper navigation and mobile-specific UI patterns following Material Design (or other similar options) principles.

## Requirements & Relevant Skills

- Experience with Android development (Kotlin preferred)
- Understanding of mobile app architecture
- Familiarity with REST APIs and data fetching
- Knowledge of Android design guidelines and Material Design (or other similar options)

## Deliverables

- Fully functional Android application
- Source code with proper documentation
- User documentation
- [Optional] Testing infrastructure!

With the final outcome being to launch this application to the playstore!

## Mentors

- Jonathan Samuel ([GitHub](https://github.com/JRS296), [Discord](https://discord.com/jrs296))

> We would like you to hopefully mentor the next generation as well! (This is the Dijkstra way, we learn to teach!) and to hopefully become a codeowner that other developers can look to for knowledge and guidance down the years.
