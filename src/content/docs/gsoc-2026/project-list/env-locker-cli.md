description: Command-line tool for securely managing environment variables
---

**Duration:** 175 Hours \
**Difficulty:** Medium \
**Languages & Technologies:** TBD \
**Repository:** TBD

## Overview

This project involves developing a command-line interface (CLI) tool that allows users to securely lock, manage, and share environment variables. This tool will help developers manage sensitive configuration data safely.

## Objectives

- Design and implement a secure CLI tool
- Create encryption mechanisms for environment variables
- Implement user authentication and authorization
- Build sharing and collaboration features
- Ensure cross-platform compatibility
- Provide clear documentation and usage examples

## Requirements

- Strong CLI development skills
- Understanding of encryption and security
- Experience with command-line argument parsing
- Knowledge of secure storage mechanisms
- Understanding of environment variable management

## Deliverables

- Fully functional CLI tool
- Secure encryption implementation
- Cross-platform support
- Comprehensive documentation
- Usage examples and tutorials

> We would like you to hopefully mentor the next generation as well! (This is the Dijkstra way, we learn to teach!) and to hopefully become a codeowner that other developers can look to for knowledge and guidance down the years.
