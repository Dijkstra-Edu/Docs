title: Enhance the capabilites of Dijkstra-Intelligence 
description: Build AI workflows to provide learning roadmaps, suggestions and intelligent interactions based on content in the Dijkstra Learning Hub
---

**Duration:** 350 Hours \
**Difficulty:** Hard 

## Overview

This project focuses on enhancing Dijkstra Intelligence by building an AI-driven system that maintains contextual awareness of a student’s progress, activity, and performance, as well as the broader content available across the Dijkstra ecosystem.

The system will leverage this contextual understanding to guide students toward their individual learning and career goals through personalized recommendations and intelligent interactions. To achieve this, the project will implement a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mechanism over Dijkstra’s content sources, including blogs and learning materials, enabling accurate, up-to-date, and context-aware responses.

An AI-powered chatbot will provide an interactive interface for users, while guardrails and safety mechanisms will be implemented to prevent misuse and ensure responsible behavior. Overall, the project aims to make Dijkstra Intelligence a reliable, content-aware guide for students navigating the Dijkstra platform.

## Objectives

- Set up and maintain a vector database aligned with and continuously synchronized to content across the Dijkstra ecosystem.
- Implement a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline to enable context-aware and content-grounded responses.
- Build an AI-powered chatbot that allows users to interact with the system using full awareness of platform content and individual student context.
- Implement guardrails and safety mechanisms to prevent misuse, hallucinations, and unauthorized or inappropriate responses.
- Enable the AI to generate personalized learning roadmaps based on a student’s goals, progress, and activity.
- Provide contextual and actionable suggestions to guide students toward relevant content, projects, and next steps.

## Requirements

- Basic knowledge of Artificial Intelligence Tools, Prompt Engineering and Databases.
- Willingness to think outside the box and experiment.

## Deliverables

- A vector database synchronized with Dijkstra content.
- A working RAG pipeline for content-grounded AI responses.
- An AI chatbot integrated into the Dijkstra platform.
- Guardrails to ensure safe and responsible AI usage.
- Personalized learning roadmap generation.
- Context-aware suggestions and recommendations.

> We would like you to hopefully mentor the next generation as well! (This is the Dijkstra way, we learn to teach!) and to hopefully become a codeowner that other developers can look to for knowledge and guidance down the years.
