**Duration:** 175-350 Hours \
**Difficulty:** Medium \
**Languages & Technologies:** TypeScript \
**Repository:** [Dijkstra-Edu/Dijkstra-Web](https://github.com/Dijkstra-Edu/Dijkstra-Web), [Dijkstra-Edu/Dataforge](https://github.com/Dijkstra-Edu/Dataforge), [Dijkstra-Edu/Gitripper](https://github.com/Dijkstra-Edu/Gitripper)

## Overview

This project involves building a public student dashboard to showcase individual achievements, along with a certificate generation and verification system for courses, projects, and platform contributions on Dijkstra.

Each certificate includes a QR code that links directly to the student’s public dashboard, enabling easy verification and sharing. The dashboard provides a consolidated view of a student’s profile and activity, including GitHub statistics, LeetCode performance, platform rank, completed projects, and relevant work experience. It serves as a simple, standardized way for students to present their credentials to universities and employers.

Certificates are generated only after a student has been active on the Dijkstra platform for a minimum of six months. The system explicitly reflects the student’s level of engagement and consistency during this period, ensuring that certificates represent meaningful and sustained participation.
  
## Objectives

- Design and implement a public student dashboard
- Create a certificate generator system
- Implement certificate verification mechanisms
- Allow students to customize and share their public profiles
- Display achievements, certificates, and progress
- Ensure privacy controls and customization options

## Requirements & Relevant Skills

- Experience with web development (React, Vue, or similar)
- Understanding of certificate generation (PDF, image generation)
- Knowledge of data visualization and dashboard design
- Familiarity with authentication and authorization
- Understanding of privacy and security considerations

## Deliverables

- Fully functional student public dashboard
- Certificate generator with customizable templates
- Certificate verification system
- Profile customization features
- Integration with existing Dijkstra platform
- Documentation

> We would like you to hopefully mentor the next generation as well! (This is the Dijkstra way, we learn to teach!) and to hopefully become a codeowner that other developers can look to for knowledge and guidance down the years.
