title: Browser Extension for Autofilling Profile Data
description: Browser extension to autofill profile data on Dijkstra platform
---

**Duration:** 90 Hours \
**Difficulty:** Easy 

## Overview

This project involves creating a browser extension that automatically fills in profile information—such as job experience, resume details, education, certifications, and related data—on job portals and online application forms for users on the Dijkstra platform.

Through this project, we aim to streamline the repetitive application process by leveraging a user’s existing Dijkstra profile.

## Objectives

- Develop a cross-browser extension (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- Implement secure data storage and management
- Create user-friendly interface for extension settings
- Integrate with Dijkstra Web platform

## Requirements

- Experience with browser extension development
- Understanding of web APIs and browser storage
- Understanding of security best practices for extensions
- Familiarity with manifest files and extension architecture

## Deliverables

- Functional browser extension supported by multiple browsers
- Extension store submissions (if applicable)
- User documentation
- Privacy and security documentation

> We would like you to hopefully mentor the next generation as well! (This is the Dijkstra way, we learn to teach!) and to hopefully become a codeowner that other developers can look to for knowledge and guidance down the years.
