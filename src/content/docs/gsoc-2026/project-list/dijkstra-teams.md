title: Build the Dijkstra Team Planner
description: Create a centralized system for team discovery, management, and collaboration within the Dijkstra ecosystem
---

**Duration:** 90 Hours \
**Difficulty:** Medium 

## Overview

This project focuses on building the **Dijkstra Team Planner**, a centralized web experience for showcasing teams, managing team structures, and improving collaboration across the Dijkstra ecosystem.

The Team Planner will provide clear visibility into existing teams, their goals, and their hierarchy, while also offering tools for team management through a dedicated HQ interface. Users will be able to explore teams, understand how to join them, and view team information in an intuitive and structured manner.

The project also aims to enhance team communication and organization by introducing visual representations of team structures, including a **graph-based view**. Overall, the Team Planner will serve as the foundation for coordinated teamwork and community growth on the Dijkstra platform.

## Objectives

- Build a public-facing interface to **showcase all Dijkstra teams** and their purpose.
- Design a **team management (HQ) system** for maintaining team hierarchy and roles.
- Provide clear guidance on **how users can join teams**.
- Implement a **visual graph view** to represent team structures and relationships.

## Requirements

- Understanding of Data Structures 
- Knowledge of Database Design
- Willingness to collaborate and iterate on design and functionality.
- Basic understanding of UI/UX principles.

## Deliverables

- A Team Planner page integrated into the Dijkstra platform.
- Team discovery and showcase functionality.
- Team HQ interface for managing hierarchy and roles.
- Visual graph-based representation of teams with shareable links.
- Documentation for future contributors and maintainers.

> We would like you to hopefully mentor the next generation as well! (This is the Dijkstra way, we learn to teach!) and to hopefully become a codeowner that other developers can look to for knowledge and guidance down the years.
