## Overview

This project involves developing a comprehensive verification engine that can verify user contributions and credentials within the Dijkstra ecosystem. This system will help ensure the authenticity and quality of user contributions.

## Objectives

- Design and implement a verification system architecture
- Create mechanisms to verify user contributions
- Implement credential verification processes
- Build APIs for verification services
- Ensure security and reliability of the verification process

## Requirements

- Strong backend development skills
- Understanding of authentication and authorization
- Knowledge of API design and development
- Experience with database design
- Understanding of security best practices

## Deliverables

- Verification engine backend system
- APIs for verification services
- Database schema and migrations
- Security documentation
- Integration with existing Dijkstra systems
