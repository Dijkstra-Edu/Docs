**Repository:** [Dijkstra-Edu/Dijkstra-Web](https://github.com/Dijkstra-Edu/Dijkstra-Web), [Dijkstra-Edu/Dataforge](https://github.com/Dijkstra-Edu/Dataforge), [Dijkstra-Edu/Helios](https://github.com/Dijkstra-Edu/Helios)

## Overview

This project involves developing a comprehensive verification engine that can verify user contributions and credentials within the Dijkstra ecosystem. This system will help ensure the authenticity and quality of user contributions.

## Objectives

- Design and implement a verification system architecture
- Create mechanisms to verify user contributions
- Implement credential verification processes
- Build APIs for verification services
- Ensure security and reliability of the verification process

## Requirements

- Strong backend development skills
- Understanding of authentication and authorization
- Knowledge of API design and development
- Experience with database design
- Understanding of security best practices

## Deliverables

- Verification engine backend system
- APIs for verification services
- Database schema and migrations
- Security documentation
- Integration with existing Dijkstra systems

## Mentors

- Dellwyn Tennison ([GitHub](https://github.com/happydracula), [Discord](https://discord.com/happydracula))
- Kush Ojha ([GitHub](https://github.com/keri-prog), [Discord](https://discord.com/keri_k))

> We would like you to hopefully mentor the next generation as well! (This is the Dijkstra way, we learn to teach!) and to hopefully become a codeowner that other developers can look to for knowledge and guidance down the years.
