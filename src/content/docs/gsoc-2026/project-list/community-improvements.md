## Overview

This project focuses on improving the **UI/UX of community pages and resources** on the Dijkstra platform to better serve the community, enhance the discoverability of resources, and increase overall user engagement. The goal is to ensure that community pages clearly reflect **Dijkstra’s core principles**, values, and culture, while remaining intuitive, accessible, and visually consistent with the broader platform.

In addition, the project includes integrating a **feedback and contact mechanism** to enable more direct and effective communication with users. This will help the Dijkstra team better understand community needs, gather actionable insights, and continuously improve the platform based on user input.
