title: Process
description: Contribution and review process followed in Dijkstra.
---

This document explains how the projects at Dijktra are managed. 
Clarity in process reduces friction, avoids burnout, and ensures the project scales sustainably.

---

## Issue Lifecycle

Every change in Dijkstra begins with an issue.

### 1. Issue Opened
Anyone may open an issue.

Issues can represent:
- bugs
- feature requests
- refactors
- documentation improvements
- architectural discussions
- questions that may evolve into changes

A good issue includes:
- clear problem description
- context or motivation
- expected vs actual behavior (for bugs)
- screenshots, logs, or examples if applicable

Incomplete issues may be asked for clarification before moving forward.

---

### 2. Maintainer Triage
Maintainers review newly opened issues to:
- verify scope and relevance
- detect duplicates
- assess urgency and impact
- determine whether the issue fits project goals

At this stage, maintainers may:
- ask follow-up questions
- suggest alternatives
- close issues that are out of scope (with explanation)

Triage ensures effort is spent where it matters most.

---

### 3. Labeling & Prioritization
Issues are labeled to communicate intent and difficulty.

Labels help contributors quickly understand:
- *what kind* of issue this is
- *who* it is suitable for
- *how urgent* it is

Prioritization balances:
- user impact
- technical debt
- maintainer bandwidth
- long-term roadmap

Not all issues are equal—and that’s okay.

---

### 4. Assignment
Issues may be:
- self-assigned by contributors
- explicitly assigned by maintainers
- left unassigned for open contribution

Before starting work:
- comment on the issue to claim it
- wait for confirmation if requested

This avoids duplicated work and frustration.

---

### 5. Development
Once assigned, development begins.

Expectations during development:
- follow contribution and coding guidelines
- keep changes focused and scoped to the issue
- communicate progress if work is long-running
- ask questions early if blocked

Large changes should be broken into smaller, reviewable steps whenever possible.

---

### 6. Review
All changes go through review.

Review focuses on:
- correctness
- maintainability
- readability
- alignment with project goals
- potential edge cases or regressions

Feedback may include:
- requested changes
- questions for clarification
- suggestions (not all are mandatory)

Reviews are about improving the *code*, not judging the *author*.

---

### 7. Merge
Once approved:
- the change is merged by a maintainer
- commit history is preserved or squashed as appropriate
- related issues are linked and resolved

Merges happen deliberately—not rushed.

---

### 8. Close
Issues are closed when:
- the change is merged
- the issue is resolved another way
- the issue is no longer relevant

Closed does not mean ignored—it means *concluded*.

---

## Issue Labels 

Labels are a navigation system for contributors and maintainers.

### Core Labels

- `good first issue`  
  Beginner-friendly issues with limited scope and clear direction.  
  Ideal for first-time contributors.

- `help wanted`  
  Issues the maintainers explicitly want help with.  
  Often higher-impact or time-sensitive.

- `bug`  
  Incorrect or unexpected behavior that needs fixing.

- `enhancement`  
  Improvements or new features that extend functionality.

- `documentation`  
  Changes related to guides, READMEs, comments, or explanations.

### Why Labels Matter
Labels:
- reduce onboarding friction
- signal expectations clearly
- help prioritize review effort
- prevent contributor burnout

Always check labels before starting work.

## Decision Making

Dijkstra values **open discussion with clear ownership**.

### Maintainer Authority
- Maintainers have final decision-making authority
- This responsibility exists to protect project direction and stability

Authority is exercised with explanation, not silence.

---

### Technical Merit Over Opinion
Decisions are guided by:
- technical correctness
- long-term maintainability
- clarity and simplicity
- alignment with project goals

Arguments backed by reasoning, benchmarks, or examples carry weight.

---

### Consensus First
Whenever possible:
- decisions are discussed openly
- alternatives are considered
- trade-offs are made explicit

Consensus builds trust and shared understanding.

---

### Respectful Disagreement
Disagreement is normal and healthy.

Expected behavior:
- challenge ideas, not people
- explain *why* you disagree
- accept final decisions gracefully

Hostility or dismissiveness is never acceptable.
