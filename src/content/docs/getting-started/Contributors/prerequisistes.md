title: Prerequisites
description: Required tools and setup instructions before contributing.
---
Welcome to Dijkstra-Edu 👋  
We’re glad you’re interested in contributing.

This document exists to help contributors:
- understand expectations before contributing
- avoid common pitfalls that slow down reviews
- align with the project’s technical and cultural standards
- become effective long-term contributors

Before you contribute, please make sure to go through these pre-requistes. Familarize yourself with the tools, technologies and frameworks. This would make contributing, understanding the codebases and contributing a whole lot easier.  



### Contributor Mindset
---
Dijkstra-Edu is a collaborative source project.

We expect contributors to:
- prioritize **maintainability over cleverness**
- respect existing design decisions
- communicate clearly and professionally
- treat reviews as collaboration, not confrontation

Questions are always welcome here at Dijkstra. However, make sure you go through the documentation before raising questions. 


### Required Knowledge
---
#### Git & Github
You should be comfortable with:
- forks and remotes
- creating and switching branches
- pulling upstream changes
- resolving merge conflicts
- writing meaningful commit messages

#### Programming and SWE Fundamentals
- basic debugging skills
- understanding of modular code
- ability to read and comprehend unfamiliar code
- a good understanding of the best practices in the the domains you are contributing to i.e frontend, backend, devops, etc. 
- writing readable, maintainable code
- following existing project architecture and patterns
- avoiding unnecessary rewrites
- writing small, focused pull requests
- adding or updating tests when appropriate
- documenting non-obvious logic or decisions

#### Tech Stack
We are currently working on a wide array of projects and features. Feel free to browse around. We require expertise in various frameworks, languages and technologies - Rust, SpringBoot, Typescript, Kotlin, ReactJS, Javascript, NextJS to name a few. 


### Communication Skills
---
Clear communication is essential for successful contributions.

You should be comfortable with:
- asking precise, well-researched questions
- participating in discussions on GitHub Issues and Pull Requests
- explaining your approach and design decisions
- responding to code review feedback constructively
- providing regular progress updates.

Silence or lack of updates is considered a serious red flag during the program.


### Development Environment
---
You should be able to set up and work in a local development environment.

This includes:
- installing and configuring required runtimes (JDK, Node.js, Rust toolchain, etc.)
- running projects locally from source
- understanding environment variables and configuration files
- using package managers (npm, yarn, cargo, gradle, maven)
- reading and following project-specific setup instructions

If you cannot run a project locally, you should not start contributing to it.

### Learning & Adaptability
---
You do not need to know everything upfront, but you must be willing to learn.

You should be comfortable with:
- learning new technologies independently
- reading documentation and source code
- adapting to feedback and changing requirements
- improving your skills over time

Curiosity and initiative are strongly valued.

### Resources
