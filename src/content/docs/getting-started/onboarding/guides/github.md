## Key GitHub Features

### Stars
Stars are a way to **bookmark or show appreciation** for a repository.

You can use stars to:
- Save repositories you like
- Discover popular projects
- Show support to open-source maintainers

Think of stars as a **“like” or favorite button** on GitHub. Make sure to star all of Dijkstra's repositories!

### Forks
A fork is your **personal copy of someone else’s repository**.

Forks are useful when:
- You want to experiment without affecting the original project
- You want to contribute to open source
- You want to learn by modifying existing code

After making changes in a fork, you can open a **Pull Request**.

---

### Pull Requests (PRs)
Pull Requests are how you **propose changes** to a repository.

A PR:
- Shows what code you changed
- Allows maintainers to review your work
- Enables discussion before merging changes

Once approved, your changes get merged into the main project.

---

### Issues
Issues are used to **track bugs, ideas, and tasks**.

Issues can be:
- Bug reports
- Feature requests
- Questions or discussions

They help teams organize work and communicate clearly.
